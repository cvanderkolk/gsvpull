# gsvpull
This python script pulls JPG images from the Google Street View API.

You can list the addresses/locations directly in an array in the script, but I found it easier to list them in a seperate file (addresses.dat).
You aren't limited to addresses, you can put in locations, landmarks, general search stuff.
The API will take pretty much anything you will throw at it that it has data for, so go crazy.

I did this for funsies as a challenge, go team.
